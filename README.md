# Thor - Your ultimate training companion.  

Thor is a Web3 decentralized fitness application powered by artificial intelligence. The app uses computer vision technology to detect body movements. Thor is created for those who feel the need for a healthy lifestyle, while at the same time motivating users to stay fit through an innovative approach: AI Fitness & Earn. All you need to get started is a smartphone and an app.

The project's long-term goal is to disrupt the blockchain and home fitness industries with an application incorporating artificial intelligence, NFTs, and tokens. The main goal is to create the world's most popular fitness app and allow millions of users to develop healthy habits while receiving real crypto assets.
Thor uses advanced artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies to recognize 32 joints using a smartphone and track all basic human movements, as well as determine the user's body position in real time and with high accuracy. This is a key difference from the traditional Move to Earn concept, which focuses solely on running.

Artificial intelligence technologies in Tor recognize movements using:

### 1. Recognition and tracking of the main points of the limbs;

### 2. Recognition and counting of movements characteristic of the limbs;

### 3. Feedback regarding whether a particular movement is sufficiently standard and correct.

### 4 AI to create personalized rehabilitation plans for injured athletes, adapting the program based on progress and real-time feedback.

### 7. Meal planning. Combines genetic information with artificial intelligence to create personalized nutrition plans for athletes based on their unique genetic makeup and performance goals.

### 8. Real-time feedback systems. Integrates motion capture technology and artificial intelligence algorithms to provide instant insight into an athlete's form and performance, helping to make immediate adjustments during training.

      Thor is more like an advanced and updated version of traditional fitness apps in the metaverse. In today's environment, where almost every web3 application has a fairly high barrier to entry, Tor is unrivaled. Combined with an accessible "fitness at home" concept for everyone, a large number of apps and a strong international team dedicated to developing and promoting the project, Thor is highly likely to become the next generation unicorn project and achieve long-term success. . the long-term goal is 10 million registered users.
